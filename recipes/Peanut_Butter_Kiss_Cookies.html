    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This peanut butter kiss cookie recipe, with its four ingredients and irresistible results, almost seems too good to be true. But trust us: These decadent and easy peanut butter cookies with Hershey's Kisses are very, very real.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>18 milk chocolate candy kisses, unwrapped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir sugar, peanut butter, and egg together in a mixing bowl until well combined.</li>
        <br>

        <br>
